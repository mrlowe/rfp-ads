                <h3>Changing Your Website</h3>
                <p>
                    There are several ways to put a funding banner, link or popup
                    on your website. The first thing you'll need to figure out is who is going to
                    make the change to the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you'd like First Financial Bank to make the change,
                    please <a href="https://ffinonline.com/RFP/home/contact">contact the First Finance support team</a>.
                    We offer this service at no charge to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're comfortable making the change yourself, you can find instructions below.

                    Sometimes, you just want to add a "financing" button to the homepage, so visitors know
                    you offer financing through First Financial Bank. That's why First Finance
                    provides an HTML code snippet that you can drop into any web page.
                    <p>
                        To get the HTML snippet for your customers,
                        <a href="https://ffinonline.com/RFP">log in to the dealer dashboard</a>,
                        scroll to the bottom of the page and copy out the HTML for the financing button.
                        Then paste that HTML into the code of your page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="dashboard-screen.png" width="100%">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you don't have a place to insert HTML or don't know how to do it, you can
                        download one of the images below, drop it into to one of your pages and link it directly
                        to the First Finance online application. To download the image, right-click and choose
                        "Save Image As...".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll also need the dealer's application link, which you can find in the
                        HTML sample on the dashboard. Or you can <a href="https://ffinonline.com/RFP/home/contact">contact First Finance support</a>
                        to get the application link for your business.
